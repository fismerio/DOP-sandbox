These basic experiments with a river metaphor superimposed on the 
the gray scale image of the webcam.

My dream would be that the river contains some meaningful visualization 
of source code and my silhouette could manipulate the river
and the related source code.

PARTS OF A RIVER

Rivers, streams and creeks, are described as, a flow of freshwater through a natural channel within the land.   Rivers are made up of some easily recognisable parts.

River bed: The bottom surface of the river, which the water flows on top.

Source: Where the river starts from, usually a lake, glacier, snowfield or spring.

Banks: The edge or sides of the river that the water flows within.  The terms right and left bank are determined by which side of the river the bank is one when facing downstream.

Course: The path of the river.

Channel: Can mean two things- either the river bed or the line deepest water through the river.
