# DOP-sandbox

Dance-Oriented Programming Sandbox - an IDE for exploring programming with the body.

Here is a place where skeletal-tracking, maintenance, refactoring, construction and specification come together.

Where computer scientists, movement researchers, and graphic designers, can collaborate to create a concrete beginning.

All participants with a sincere interest in collaborating are welcome. Egos come and go, the meaningful work stays.

I have already started looking at:



*   Christian Theobalt - VNect: Real-time 3D Human Pose Estimation with a Single RGB Camera.
*   [https://tvico.io/](https://tvico.io/) and Nuitrack
*   [https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) 
*   OpenCV - [https://opencv.org/](https://opencv.org/) 
    *   [https://youtu.be/WQeoO7MI0Bs](https://youtu.be/WQeoO7MI0Bs) - LEARN OPENCV in 3 HOURS with Python | Including 3x Example Projects (2020)

Extreme exploration is INTENDED.

THIS IS NOT A SHORT TERM PROJECT.
